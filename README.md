# Human-Protein-Atlas-Image-Classification
Kaggle Competition to classify images and their components using CNN

January 3rd.
It's my first time doing CNN's and it's been a challenge. I started with only 2 weeks left in the competition and ran into a plethora of issues which I've learned from. Kaggle kernels have been priceless.
The need for a GPU has been paramount so I've used google credit to run them online as my laptops 1050ti leads to overheating when dealing with deeper networks.
It takes me about 3 days to train my models. With only 2 models run I'm currently 45th out of 2111 teams. 
My server ran out of credits near the end of my last training and crashed so I lost a couple days from that. I'm hoping the next set of experiments are fruitful and I can further improve my placement if even by a little, mostly to demonstrate my potential for the field.

I'll post the code next week once the comp is over.
